# LEO: Auto-typing Tool for Teaching Coding

**LEO** is a teaching assistant for windows that auto-types code from a lesson plan.

### 📦 Dependencies
Make sure to install the following **in order**:

1. [Python 3.12.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3122)
2. [AutoHotkey v1.1.37.02](https://www.autohotkey.com)
3. [`python_ahk` – A Python wrapper for AutoHotkey](https://pypi.org/project/ahk)

### 🔧 VS Code Setup (Optional)
If you don't have a preferred code editor, I recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
It comes with advanced features that help experienced coders. These (may) interfere with LEO lesson plans.
You can disable them by loading the VS Code settings provided in the settings folder.

**How to Apply Settings**:
1. Open VS Code.
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P`.
3. Search for **"Open User Settings (JSON)"**.
4. Paste the contents of the desired JSON file into the settings and save.

## 📝 Notes

- 🪟 **Windows only**.
- 💻 Most of the code is written in Python.
- ⚙️ Requires some understanding of AutoHotkey (AHK).
- ❗Current version of AHK (v1.1.37.02) is now deprecated (still works at the moment)
- `screen.ahk` provides optional window management shortcuts:
  - `Ctrl + Shift + Space`: Keep window on top.
  - `Ctrl + Shift + T`: Toggle window transparency.
- `kill.bat` stops all AHK scripts (check system tray for active ones).
